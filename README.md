### 🛣 My Journey
My career combines deep technical expertise with a passion for education and problem-solving:

*   **Early Foundation:** A lifelong passion for technology, starting with programming on a Commodore 64, later formalized through a Computer Science & Mathematics degree at TU Dortmund. My diploma thesis focused on designing a high-performance Fast Marching algorithm for real-world manufacturing software.
*   **Professional Development:** Began my career as a Software Developer at DR. MARKET SOFTWARE TECHNIK AG, developing automated testing systems and robust Java applications in an Agile environment.
*   **Academic Leadership:** Spent 9 years in Chinese academia as a Senior Technical Instructor and Lecturer, designing and delivering curricula in Java, mobile development, and full software project lifecycles.
*   **Return to Core Development:** Now, I am fully refocused on modern backend software development. I am eager to leverage my algorithmic thinking, extensive Java/Spring Boot expertise, and unique experience in teaching complex systems to contribute to high-performing backend teams in Ireland.

This combination of hands-on development experience, algorithmic rigor, and teaching background allows me to quickly master complex systems and contribute effectively to team growth and project success.
